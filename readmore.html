        is an algorithm I developed in my research, alongside a team of six
        under the Rutgers Aresty Undergrad Research Program. It's created by
        combining the techniques of hierarchical pathfinding, A*, and influence
        maps.
        <br /><br />
        The image below is the virtual environment made in Unity used for the
        study. It's a model of a hospital building. Each colored area is
        considered a "zone." I used zones to create higher level searches for
        A*, which result in hierarchical pathfinding.
        <br /><br />

        <br /><br />
        My case study was crowd congestion, which is displayed in this image
        below. An influence map is placed in the environment to quantify crowds
        in the environment. With this map, new values are added to each agent's
        pathfinding calculations. Visually, this makes the environment look like a heat
        map, with red areas being more favorable. The result is a pathfinding
        algorithm that not only finds the shortest path, but one that also
        considers the dynamic stimuli of the agents, like noise, crowds,
        visibility, etc. The disadvantages of this implementation is efficiency
        though, since the pathfinding algorithm re-calculates paths for the
        entire environment at each frame.

        In retrospective, this was my first experience working with a large team
        in a professional setting! The study was an overall success, despite the
        efficiency errors in the code. I not became more proficient with Unity
        and C#, but I also learned soft skills pivotal for any leader or team
        player. ü§ó

      is my current personal project, where I'm creating a video game in 100
      Days, following the #100DaysOfGameDev challenge. You can follow my journey
      and see more progress on my Twitter, as my knowledge for game development
      and Unity continues to expand. The below .gif is an implementation of the
      bullets in Unity, with different bullet paths, timings, and directions.
      It's one of my first contributions to the challenge! üôåüèº

      My fascination for the bullet hell genre comes from my love for the Touhou
      series. Despite the difficulty of the series, their games have a way of
      calming me down. üòé

      game, named
      <a href="https://marchmayjune.itch.io/notes-on-crying"
        >notes on crying,</a
      >
      is my first finished game and a personal project, inspired by the need for
      more mental health themed games in the industry. It's availble on itch.io
      to play, following the links.
      <br /><br />
      I attempted to make the development as quick as possible so that I can
      learn programming skills quickly and move onto another project. Specifically, it was done
      in 4 days, doing all
      the designing, artwork, animations, sounds, and programming by myself. ü§òüèº Sadly, the lack of time resulted in messy code and little
      polish. I did learn the importance of planning though. Now, I love mapping out the systems of a coding project,
      jotting down what they
      need and how they interact with one another. ü•∞

        Android Chess

      <b>Android Chess</b> is a clone of chess built as an android app! It features the whole
      game of chess, including all its traditional rules and moves, and a replay function that
      allows players to watch one of the games they've played. It's one of the last academic projects I made
      in college. In terms of development, I found that coding for android was quite simple!
      Below is a screenshot of the simple UI, taken from Android Studio's emulator.

      <b>Song Library</b> is a simple academic project implemented in a pair.
      With Java and JavaFX, the user can add, delete, and edit songs into an
      organized song library. <br /><br />
      While this project was certainly not large or the first project I made UI
      for, it is certainly a learning experience nonetheless! Below is a
